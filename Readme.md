# Circles
Find circles in a picture and mark them and the centre.

This short python script marks all circles and their centres in an image in jpg format.
1. make sure you have installed cv2
2. create two folders in your project folder, one should be called "original", the other "detected"
3. move the images you want to analyse into the folder "original"
4. run the programme
5. in the folder "detected" you will see all the images where circles have been detected, the circles and the centres are now marked in green colour
6. if there is an image in which no circles were found, this is displayed in the console.
